Hi, I am Bhargava Ram Kanda, a product, engineering, and machine learning 
enthusiast. I am experienced in product management, full stack 
development, and machine learning. My ideal state is to be 
developing advanced ML products with social impact. 

This is the place I try to express myself through 
the code I write in my free time. Most of my work, since 
tied to companies, has to be kept private. However, I have
gathered here all the projects I could keep open. I will
be talking about some of them in detail.
